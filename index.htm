				<h1>about : Blake</h1>
				<p>Hi I'm Blake! I'm a hobbyist developer putting heavy focus on learning python amidst other programming languages, with an equal stress between frontend development and command line development and optimization.</p>
				<p><b>Programming.</b></p>
				<p>i've been studying python for around a year now, and have started a small handfull of functional projects spanning from scripts aiding in my workflow to useful calculation utilities for tabletop gaming. I've submerged myself deep inside many linux distrobutions and can firmly say I know how to confidently use shells such as the Bourne-Again Shell, and Z Shell to operate and carry out my day-to-day tasks, as well as satisfy my programming needs.</p>
